### Task
Create a Windows Forms Application to allow a user to enter the details of their video game collection (title,
platform, genre and publisher) into a 2D array with 10 elements (simple 2D string array â€“ not collections).

#### Add the following features;
  * Create a global 2D string array, use static variables for the dimensions (size),
  * Create an ADD button that will store the information from the 4 text boxes to the 2D array,
  * Create a CLEAR button to clear the four text boxes so a new game can be added,
  * Write the code for a simple Bubble Sort method to sort the 2D array by Game Title ascending, ensure
you use a separate swap method that passes the array element to be swapped (do not use any built in
array methods),
  * Write the code for a Binary Search for the Game Title in the 2D array and display the information in the
other textboxes when found, add suitable feedback if the search in not successful (do not use any built
in array methods),
  * Create a SAVE button so the information from the 2D array can be written into a binary file called
games.dat which is sorted by Game Title,
  * Create a LOAD button that will read the information from binary file called games.dat into the 2D array,
  * Create a display method that will show all the games data in a List box,
  * Draw a UML activity diagram for the binary search method.
