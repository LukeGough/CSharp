### Task
Create a Windows Forms Application to allow a user to enter the details of a book reference (title, author, date
and publisher) into 4 input text boxes. When the Add Book button is clicked the book details are displayed in
the following format: Author, Date. Title. Publisher. (Note the punctuation)

The following features are required;
• A separate class called book.cs will be created to contain the book information (4 attributes),
• All 4 attributes are to be private and are of data type “string”, (Option: use a DateTime data type for the
Date).
• Rename the form1.cs file to “MyBooksForm.cs”,
• Write accessor methods to store and retrieve all information for the attributes (Set and Get),
• Create an array of type book with size 10, (use a static variable for the array size),
• A button click method that adds the details of each book to the single dimension book array, and then
clears the input text boxes,
• An output list box to display the books from the array (Optional: create a display method in the book
class),
• Draw a UML class diagram for the book class
